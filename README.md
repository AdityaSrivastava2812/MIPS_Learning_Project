# RISC Processor Implementation Project

#Overview

This repository aims to implement and document the making of a RISC architecture.  
This is a learning project, hence we will keep updating it as we learn new things and grow.

**Contributors:** **Aditya**(https://github.com/AdityaSrivastava2812) and  **Yug**(https://github.com/llYuGll)  
we welcome contributions, so please feel free to submit pull request.

We promise to commit ourselves to the development of this project. It will not only include the implementation but also proper documentation of our learnings and mistakes. We will not remove any of our previous versions of the project and will keep iterating it to the optimal level.

For starters, we will implement the basic RISC architecture as given in the *Computer Organization and Design* book by Hennessy.(Single clock) 
We will also add RTL synthesis and other details as we make progress.

├── Iteration1, Iteration2...
            ├──All the modules in this iteration(ALU,REG FILE , Read me etc)

└── README.md (for overall projects) 

**Next Steps:**  
Begin with the single-cycle implementation under iteration1, then proceed to synthesis and pipelining.
