#Synthesis Analysis - Iteration 1

We attempted to synthesize our Iteration 1 design. The synthesis tool (Yosys) identified some structural issues, which are documented in the attached reports.

This folder contains all reports generated during the synthesis process using the Yosys tool. Although we can modify to clear these errors in same iteration we
have decided to start 2nd iteration which will address all these issues along with some other changes. Iteration 2 will be a completly sythesizable, it will also 
contain Test benches and Waveform outputs.

Also attaching RTL .png for iteration 1 which shocases some of our errors due to improper implimentation. (also will add RTL from Quartus.)

**Note:**
For this synthesis analysis, we did not use any external standard cell library. Yosys was allowed to use its internal standard library for mapping and optimization.

All relevant statistics and reports are included in this folder
